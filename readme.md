# fsreadcache[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kesla/fsreadcache.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kesla/fsreadcache)

Cache calls to fs.read.

Please note that this module is using an in-memory cache, so multiple processes (or multiple instances of fsreadcache) can't use the same filedescriptors.

## Installation

```
npm install fsreadcache
```

## Example

### Input

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
  , fsreadcache = require('./fsreadcache')({
        // optional cacheSize, defaults to 100mb
        cacheSize: 16 * 1024
    })
  , fd = fs.openSync(__dirname + '/testdata/example-file', 'w+')
  , input = new Buffer('123')

// must use fsreadache.write for the cache to be set correctly
//  when changing an already opened file
fsreadcache.write(fd, input, 0, input.length, null, function () {
  var buffer = new Buffer(3)

  fsreadcache.read(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, 0, function () {
    console.log('data read from fs:', buffer.toString())

    fsreadcache.read(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, 0, function () {
      console.log('data read from cache:', buffer.toString())
    })
  })
})
```

### Output

```
data read from fs: 123
data read from cache: 123
```
